checking base case...
success: all candidate(s) hold in the base state

checking step case...
failed: the following candidate(s) are not inductive:
- `cnt ≤ 2` = (<= cnt 2)
  |=| Step k
  |         cnt = 2
  | is_counting = false
  |       reset = false
  |  start_stop = false
  |=| Step k + 1
  |         cnt = 3
  | is_counting = true
  |       reset = false
  |  start_stop = true
  |=|
- `cnt ≤ 4` = (<= cnt 4)
  |=| Step k
  |         cnt = 4
  | is_counting = true
  |       reset = false
  |  start_stop = false
  |=| Step k + 1
  |         cnt = 5
  | is_counting = true
  |       reset = false
  |  start_stop = false
  |=|

|===| Induction attempt result
| - all candidates hold in the initial state(s)
|
| - the following candidate(s) are not inductive (not preserved by the transition relation)
|   `cnt ≤ 2`
|   `cnt ≤ 4`
|
| - system might be unsafe, some candidate(s) are not inductive
|
| - the following candidate(s) hold in the initial state(s) and are inductive
|   and thus hold in all reachable states of the system:
|   `cnt is positive`
