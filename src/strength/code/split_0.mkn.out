checking base case...
success: all candidate(s) hold in the base state

checking step case...
failed: the following candidate(s) are not inductive:
- `done then i = len` = (=> done (= i len))
  |=| Step k
  |     done = false
  | grouping = 2
  |        i = 3
  |      len = 4
  |=| Step k + 1
  |     done = true
  | grouping = 2
  |        i = 5
  |      len = 4
  |=| Z3 produced the following unexpected values
  | div0 ((x!0 int) (x!1 int)) int = 2
  | mod0 ((x!0 int) (x!1 int)) int = 0
  |=|

|===| Induction attempt result
| - all candidates hold in the initial state(s)
|
| - the following candidate(s) are not inductive (not preserved by the transition relation)
|   `done then i = len`
|
| - system might be unsafe, some candidate(s) are not inductive
|
| - the following candidate(s) hold in the initial state(s) and are inductive
|   and thus hold in all reachable states of the system:
|   `grouping > 0`
|   `i ≥ 0`
|   `len grouping related`
|   `len ≥ 0`
|   `not done then i < len`
