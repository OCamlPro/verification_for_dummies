checking base case...
success: all candidate(s) hold in the base state

checking step case...
success: all candidate(s) are inductive

|===| Induction attempt result
| - all candidates hold in the initial state(s)
|
| - all candidates are inductive (preserved by the transition relation)
|
| - system is safe, all reachable states verify the candidate(s)
